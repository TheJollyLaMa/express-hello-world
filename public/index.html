            For the final expression of my class project in Python entitled "Stealy Steve's Corner Lot Auto Stealer",
             I would like to deploy my project to the wild to help all the shady corner lot car salesman keep better
             track of the vehicles they buy and ste ... ughuuhmmm .... store.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though deployment in yet another language may sound like an outrageous undertaking, I am familiar with node and express,
            and a gentleman named Kam Lancaster reached out to me the other day to be an early reviewer of his project named "Cyclic".
            From his github, it appears he's been building Cyclic over the last year and has just released a document set.
          https://docs.cyclic.sh/
          </p>

          <p>
            I found this blog post on Cyclic's site to be clarifying in regards to how I might get started or just what it even is ...
          https://www.cyclic.sh/posts/why-i-started-cyclic

          </p>
          <h2>The Breakdown:</h2>
          <p>
            With this Cyclic express server boiler plate from Kam:
            https://github.com/TheJollyLaMa/express-hello-world

          I can authorize Cyclic access to a github repo and concurrently deploy my app with evry push to github.
          It's a 'serverless' architecture - which I do not completely understand yet but I am interested in
          learning about. Especially now.

          And here is the express-hello-world example deployed in the wild.
          https://zany-gold-shrug.cyclic.app/


          On the programmer's end, I navigate to cyclic.sh and it links with my github account through an OAuth gateway.
          Cyclic produces a Dashboard for me with the ability to deploy projects, a card library of all my deployed apps,
          and a list of any repositories it has access to that arn't deployed. The user experience is pleasant and has
          good aesthetic appeal.  The Dashboard has a number of useful features, such as console output, transaction and
          error logging, environment management, and even Self-Hosting!

          When you deploy, your app is given a random cyclic.app url like the one above and now you can interact with your app
          like any other deployed app.  But you also have that useful dashboard, and a github repo.  With every git push,
          the server is updated with nodemon.

          </p>

          I see this as a wonderful opportunity to dovetail what I've been learning in node with my newly polished
           Python3 skills.  Furthermore, I've identified git skills to be priority in this last year and this would
            really drive home some of those conepts, as well as allow me to learn more about the next level of
             collaborative software development by offering a well informed opinion to Kam and his Cyclic software.
            I would like to use Cyclic's serverless concurrent deployment architecture to attempt a deployment of Stealy Steve's app
             from a public git repo for all to see and learn about!
            The whole point of it is to get junior devs to the showroom floor without all the many lines of infrastructure
            code that is difficult and time consuming to understand and navigate!
